            Participant A sent you {{ sent_amount }}.
            They were tripled so you received {{ tripled_amount }}.
            You chose to return {{ group.sent_back_amount }}.
        </p>
        <p>
            You received {{ tripled_amount }},
            chose to return {{ group.sent_back_amount }}
            thus you now have:
            ({{ tripled_amount }})-({{ group.sent_back_amount }})=<strong>{{ player.payoff }}</strong>
