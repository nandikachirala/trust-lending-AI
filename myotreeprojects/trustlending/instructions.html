    <p>
        You are playing a version of the Trust Game in which you are Participant B and an algorithm
        will act as Participant A.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, participant A receives {{ C.ENDOWMENT }};
        participant B receives
        nothing.
        Participant A can send some or all of
        his {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to participant B.
        Before B receives this amount, it will be multiplied
        by {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}. Once B receives
        the tripled amount he can decide to send some or all of it to
        A.
